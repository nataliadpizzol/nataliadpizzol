My name is Nat and I'm a Brazilian Computer Science undergraduate and aspiring IOS developer. I enjoy creating engaging applications, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge.

I'm also passionate about promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion in the field of computer science, and I love to meet and share knowledge with other women in tech!
